# Hi there, I'm Alexander Trost 👋

I’m **Alexander Trost**, also known as **galexrt** on GitHub. I'm a **Senior Principal Kubernetes Architect** at **cargobay UG**, based in **Germany**.
I'm also a **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)**, with a deep passion for containers, Kubernetes, and open-source technologies.

### 🔧 What I Do
I'm passionate about **containers**, **Kubernetes**, and **open-source** projects and technologies. I am specialized in **"firefighting"** container and Kubernetes cluster issues, but in the end I can help with a little bit of anything.

As a **maintainer of the CNCF graduated project, Rook**, I'm dedicated to helping with persistent applications in Kubernetes.

### 💻 Technologies & Tools
Some of the languages and technologies I have worked with.

- **Languages**: Golang, Docker, YAML (K8S), Typescript, Shell scripting, whatever other language to get the job done 😉
- **Technologies**: Docker, Kubernetes, Rook, Ceph, NATS, Protobuf & GRPC

### 🌟 Current Focus
I'm always working on improving my skills and diving deeper into **Kubernetes** and container technologies. I'm continuously learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with these tools in small to large scale environments.

### 🌱 Learning & Development
I'm constantly further developing my existing skills and exploring new topics to stay at the cutting edge of **cloud-native infrastructure**.

### 🎮 Fun Fact
When I'm not working with Kubernetes and containers, I love to **play games** (Steam Deck is great for travelling ❤️) and contribute to the **Modern Gaming** community as an **infrastructure administrator**. Everything besides the gameservers themselves are running via containers in Kubernetes.
